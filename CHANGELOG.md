# Changelog

## [0.0.83] - 2026-03-17

- Fixed 422 error posting evaluation findings. Added finding key normalization and empty field guards.

## [0.0.79] - 2026-03-22

- Fixed AI evaluation context in `update_deejay_set_collection` — it was reading env vars that were never set, always defaulting to 0.
- Moved CSV processing evaluation to `process_new_files.py` with real run counts (imported, failed, skipped, tracks, API ingest, duplicates).
- Collection update runs now use `collection_update=True` with a collection-specific Claude prompt and an INFO success finding on `pipeline_consistency`.
- Wired `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `STANDARDS_VERSION` into the process-new-CSV workflow.

## [0.0.78] - 2026-03-19

- "Fixed false ERROR finding when no new sets were available
  to ingest. No-op ingest is now correctly treated as success."

## [0.0.77] - 2026-03-19

- "Improved Claude prompt for pipeline evaluation to enforce
  raw JSON output. Added system prompt for better instruction
  following."

## [0.0.76] - 2026-03-19

- Added pipeline_evaluator.py — calls Claude API after each pipeline run to evaluate conformance against standards document. Posts structured findings to deejay-marvel-api. Wired into update_deejay_set_collection workflow.

## [0.0.75] - 2026-03-18

- Moved API ingest step from `update_deejay_set_collection` to `process_new_files`. Now only newly processed CSVs are sent to deejay-marvel-api.
- Refactored `ingest_to_api.py` to expose `read_tracks_from_sheet` and `build_ingest_payload` as reusable functions.

## [0.0.74] - 2026-03-18

- Added `ingest_to_api.py` — new pipeline step that sends newly processed sets to deejay-marvel-api via POST `/v1/ingest` after collection update.
- Wired into `update_deejay_set_collection.py`. Pipeline skips API step gracefully if `KAIANO_API_BASE_URL` is not set.

## [0.0.71] - 2025-03-17

- Migrated from Poetry to uv, and from black/isort/flake8 to ruff.
- Updated README to fully describe processor purpose, inputs, outputs, and configuration.
